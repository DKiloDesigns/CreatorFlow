# Zencoder Problem Report Resolution: Billing Page Rendering Issue

## Problem Identified
- The billing page (`/dashboard/billing`) was not rendering (blank page or 500 error) after refactoring to use a server/client component split.

## Solution Implemented
1. Fixed the client component declaration by ensuring the `'use client'` directive was properly formatted at the top of the file.
2. Updated the server component (`page.tsx`) to properly serialize data before passing it to the client component.
3. Ensured proper error handling in both server and client components.
4. Fixed potential date serialization issues by converting date objects to ISO strings.

## Changes Made
1. Updated `BillingClient.tsx`:
   - Ensured the `'use client'` directive was properly formatted
   - Added proper error handling for component props

2. Updated `page.tsx`:
   - Added proper serialization of data before passing to client component
   - Improved error handling
   - Fixed potential date serialization issues

## Lessons Learned
1. When working with server/client component splits in Next.js, ensure that:
   - The `'use client'` directive is properly formatted at the top of client components
   - Data passed from server to client components is properly serialized
   - Date objects are converted to strings before passing to client components
   - Error handling is implemented in both server and client components

2. For debugging server/client component issues:
   - Start with simplified components to isolate the problem
   - Add logging to track data flow
   - Check for serialization issues with complex data types

## Status
- The billing page now renders correctly with the server/client component split.
