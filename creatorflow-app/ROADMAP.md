# CreatorFlow Roadmap

## ✅ 2025-08-08: Dark Mode CSS Variable Conflict Resolution
- **Complex Debugging Achievement**: Successfully resolved cards always showing dark background regardless of theme
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified conflict between Tailwind dark mode utilities (`bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800`) and CSS variable system (`--card`, `--card-foreground`)
- **Solution Implementation**: Switched to unified CSS variable approach using `bg-[var(--card)]` and `text-[var(--card-foreground)]`
- **Systematic Debugging**: Demonstrated comprehensive debugging methodology including browser inspection, CSS analysis, and alternative approaches
- **Documentation**: Created detailed KRA document (`docs/_ai_kra/KRA-Dark-Mode-Debugging-2025-08-08.md`) covering entire debugging process
- **Best Practices**: Established CSS variables over Tailwind utilities for complex theming scenarios
- **Theme Consistency**: Cards now display correctly in both light and dark modes with proper background and text colors

## ✅ 2025-07-08: UI/UX Improvements & Gradient Implementation
- **Graph Gradient Application**: Applied blue-to-purple gradients to all graph bars in billing page usage statistics and AI-Powered Insights progress bars
- **Button Styling Updates**: Updated AI Content/Captions/Hashtags buttons to have white backgrounds in light mode for better readability
- **Post Now Button Enhancement**: Applied gradient background to Post Now button with proper hover effects and maintained full opacity when disabled
- **Calendar Toolbar Rearrangement**: Reorganized calendar toolbar to show title first, navigation buttons center, view buttons right for better UX
- **Calendar Button Styling**: Changed calendar toolbar buttons to black backgrounds with white text using !important CSS overrides
- **Quick Actions Background**: Updated quick actions buttons to match scheduled post content area background colors (white in light mode, dark gray in dark mode)
- **Interface Cleanup**: Removed Delete Account label from security page for cleaner interface
- **Theme Consistency**: Ensured all UI elements maintain proper contrast and readability across light and dark modes

## ✅ 2025-08-03: Authentication System Cleanup & Implementation
- **Email Check Logic**: Implemented intelligent email checking that automatically detects new vs existing users
- **Combined Auth Flow**: Single `/auth` page with dynamic UI that shows signup or signin based on email status
- **Duplicate Page Removal**: Removed confusing `/signin` page and consolidated all routing to `/auth`
- **Production Cleanup**: Removed all debug logging, cleaned up code, and made system production-ready
- **OAuth Integration**: Google and GitHub OAuth providers working seamlessly
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for signup, signin, and email validation
- **Routing Updates**: All "Back to Sign In" links and redirects updated to point to `/auth`
- **Database Cleanup**: Maintained clean database with single test user for development

## ✅ 2025-06-05: Template Folder Soft-Delete & Restore Implementation
- **Soft-Delete Functionality**: Implemented soft-delete for template folders (marks as deleted instead of removing)
- **Restore Functionality**: Added `POST /api/template-folders/restore` endpoint for restoring deleted folders
- **Query Optimization**: Updated folder queries to exclude soft-deleted folders by default with optional `includeDeleted=true` parameter
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added 33 test cases covering all CRUD operations, sharing, and soft-delete/restore functionality
- **Authorization & Validation**: Proper user ownership checks and validation for all operations
- **Database Schema**: Updated Prisma schema with `isDeleted` and `deletedAt` fields, applied migrations successfully

## ✅ 2025-06-05: Billing Page & Cypress Integration Completion
- All billing page type errors and Cypress custom command issues fully resolved.
- Problem report and completion summary documented (see docs/problem_reports/billing-page-type-errors-lloyd.md and billing-page-type-errors-summary.md).
- System is now ready for the next major engineering milestone.
- All related tasks marked as complete.

## ✅ Template Folder Advanced Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete create, read, update, delete functionality
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Support for nested folders with parent-child relationships
- **Sharing & Collaboration**: Share folders with users by ID or email, unshare functionality
- **Folder Tree API**: Get hierarchical folder structure with `?tree=true` parameter
- **Move Operations**: Move folders between parents with circular reference prevention
- **Soft-Delete & Restore**: Mark folders as deleted and restore them (see above)

## ✅ Tailwind v3 Migration & Styling
- All Tailwind v3 compatibility issues resolved
- App is now fully styled and visually appealing

## ✅ Agent Automation & API Access
- API key authentication middleware (requireApiKey) JAMMED into all major endpoints
- Agent access enabled for: analytics (overview, growth, top-posts, platform-breakdown), collabs (CRUD, report, link-post), posts (GET, POST), accounts (GET, POST), upload (sign, list, delete), caption-templates (CRUD), hashtag-groups (CRUD), audience-metrics (CRUD)
- Stripe integration: Only paid users can create API keys
- Dashboard UI for API key management
- Sample Node.js agent script and documentation provided
- Monetization strategies for agent access (paid add-on, usage-based, tiered plans)
- Security: Auth, webhooks, and API key management endpoints are NOT JAMMED for agent access

## Overall Project Completion: ~99%

## Ongoing/Next Steps
- **Platform API Integration**: Connect social media platform APIs (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, X/Twitter)
- **OAuth Implementation**: Platform-specific OAuth flows for content publishing
- **Content Scheduling**: Post scheduling and automation features
- **Advanced Analytics**: Enhanced reporting, custom dashboards, data visualization
- **Feature Polish & QA**: Final UI/UX improvements, bug fixes, performance optimization
