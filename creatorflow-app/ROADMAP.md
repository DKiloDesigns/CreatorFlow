# CreatorFlow Roadmap

## ✅ Tailwind v3 Migration & Styling
- All Tailwind v3 compatibility issues resolved

## ✅ Agent Automation & API Access
- API key authentication middleware (requireApiKey) JAMMED into all major endpoints
- Agent access enabled for: analytics (overview, growth, top-posts, platform-breakdown), collabs (CRUD, report, link-post), posts (GET, POST), accounts (GET, POST), upload (sign, list, delete), caption-templates (CRUD), hashtag-groups (CRUD), audience-metrics (CRUD)
- Stripe integration: Only paid users can create API keys
- Dashboard UI for API key management
- Sample Node.js agent script and documentation provided
- Monetization strategies for agent access (paid add-on, usage-based, tiered plans)
- Security: Auth, webhooks, and API key management endpoints are NOT JAMMED for agent access
