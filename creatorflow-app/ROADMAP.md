# CreatorFlow Roadmap

## ✅ 2025-06-05: Template Folder Soft-Delete & Restore Implementation
- **Soft-Delete Functionality**: Implemented soft-delete for template folders (marks as deleted instead of removing)
- **Restore Functionality**: Added `POST /api/template-folders/restore` endpoint for restoring deleted folders
- **Query Optimization**: Updated folder queries to exclude soft-deleted folders by default with optional `includeDeleted=true` parameter
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added 33 test cases covering all CRUD operations, sharing, and soft-delete/restore functionality
- **Authorization & Validation**: Proper user ownership checks and validation for all operations
- **Database Schema**: Updated Prisma schema with `isDeleted` and `deletedAt` fields, applied migrations successfully

## ✅ 2025-06-05: Billing Page & Cypress Integration Completion
- All billing page type errors and Cypress custom command issues fully resolved.
- Problem report and completion summary documented (see docs/problem_reports/billing-page-type-errors-lloyd.md and billing-page-type-errors-summary.md).
- System is now ready for the next major engineering milestone.
- All related tasks marked as complete.

## ✅ Template Folder Advanced Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete create, read, update, delete functionality
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Support for nested folders with parent-child relationships
- **Sharing & Collaboration**: Share folders with users by ID or email, unshare functionality
- **Folder Tree API**: Get hierarchical folder structure with `?tree=true` parameter
- **Move Operations**: Move folders between parents with circular reference prevention
- **Soft-Delete & Restore**: Mark folders as deleted and restore them (see above)

## ✅ Tailwind v3 Migration & Styling
- All Tailwind v3 compatibility issues resolved
- App is now fully styled and visually appealing

## ✅ Agent Automation & API Access
- API key authentication middleware (requireApiKey) JAMMED into all major endpoints
- Agent access enabled for: analytics (overview, growth, top-posts, platform-breakdown), collabs (CRUD, report, link-post), posts (GET, POST), accounts (GET, POST), upload (sign, list, delete), caption-templates (CRUD), hashtag-groups (CRUD), audience-metrics (CRUD)
- Stripe integration: Only paid users can create API keys
- Dashboard UI for API key management
- Sample Node.js agent script and documentation provided
- Monetization strategies for agent access (paid add-on, usage-based, tiered plans)
- Security: Auth, webhooks, and API key management endpoints are NOT JAMMED for agent access

## Overall Project Completion: ~95%

## Ongoing/Next Steps
- **Feature Polish & QA**: UI/UX improvements, bug fixes, performance optimization
- **Billing Enhancement**: Complete Stripe integration, usage tracking, upgrade flows
- **Social Media Integration**: OAuth implementation, post scheduling, content publishing
- **Advanced Analytics**: Enhanced reporting, custom dashboards, data visualization
