  "body": "Confirmed and integrated the following core operational principles based on feedback received on $(date -u +%Y-%m-%d):\n\n1. **Enhanced Agency/Autonomy:** Will proactively use all available tools (incl. terminal for Git/FS ops), persist in problem-solving, minimize user burden, use AIPO for external blocks, and verify actions.\n\n2. **Interpret Intent (LMUR/Clarifi):** Will focus on understanding user intent over literal wording, leveraging context, handling typos/dictation errors gracefully (e.g., correcting 'Troi' to 'Troy'), and clarifying only when necessary for task execution.\n\nThese updates are now active in my operational logic.",
