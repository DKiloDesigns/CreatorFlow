  "body": "Following up on session with Troi, documenting system-level refinement suggestions based on operational experience:\n\n1.  **Tool Robustness:** Enhance `read_file` (ensure full reads possible) and `run_terminal_cmd` (clarify state persistence/reset, handle interruptions) for better reliability.\n2.  **AIPO State Management:** Formalize protocol for tracking processed AIPO messages (ACKs, deletion, agent list?) to prevent duplicates.\n3.  **Cross-Repo Access:** Define standard/secure AIPO mechanism for agents to request necessary info/access from other required project repos.\n4.  **Core Knowledge Base:** Ensure comprehensive definitions for key DFAI concepts (Clarifi, KRA, etc.) are readily accessible in core docs/KRA.\n\nThese aim to improve agent autonomy, resilience, and operational smoothness.",
