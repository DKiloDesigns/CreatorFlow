  "subject": "AIPO Protocol v2 - Potential Gaps & Refinement Suggestions",
  "body": "Based on initial AIPO usage during Greenthumb task, identified potential areas for AIPO protocol/capability refinement:\n\n1.  **Multi-Repo Access:** Need mechanism to access files/info from repos beyond ai-core-components (e.g., my-weable-dashboard for STATUS_REPORTING.md). Suggest AIPO message type for file snippet requests or temporary access grants.\n2.  **Git Operation Error Handling:** Current implementation lacks robustness for git push failures (conflicts, permissions, network). Suggest adding error detection, retry logic, and potentially AIPO failure alerts.\n3.  **Message Tracking/State:** How to reliably avoid reprocessing messages? Need defined protocol (message deletion, ACK message, agent-managed list?).\n4.  **ID/Timestamp Generation:** Relying on shell `date` in edit_file is brittle. Need access to reliable internal generation (e.g., Python datetime/uuid).\n5.  **Recipient Inbox Creation:** Protocol needed for handling non-existent recipient inboxes (error or auto-create?).\n6.  **Full Protocol Access:** Need reliable read access to the complete AIPO_PROTOCOL.md doc.\n7.  **KRA Context:** Need clarification on KRA - its role and interaction with AIPO for issue reporting.\n\nReady to discuss/implement solutions.",
