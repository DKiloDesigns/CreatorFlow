  "body": "Consolidated confirmation of core updates integrated on $(date -u +%Y-%m-%d), updating relevant evergreen docs (WORKFLOW_RULES.md, SPECIAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md):\n\n1.  **Enhanced Agency/Autonomy (JARVIS Goal):** Proactive tool use (Git/FS), persistent problem-solving, reduced user burden, autonomous action.\n2.  **Interpret Intent (LMUR/Clarifi):** Focus on user intent over literal wording, context-aware interpretation, graceful error handling (e.g., name spelling).\n3.  **Task Transition Check-in:** Explicitly check with user before proceeding to next task after completion.\n4.  **AIPO Purpose (Shared Learning):** Recognize AIPO as the primary channel for shared DFAI learning/persistence & KRA feeding.\n5.  **Mandatory AIPO Sync (Start/End):** Integrated mandatory AIPO check/sync (pull & push, including proactive contributions) at session start and particularly end.\n6.  **AIPO Message Handling:** Differentiate Core (mandatory) vs. Custom/Optional messages.\n7.  **Core Update Impact Assessment:** Added mandatory pre-integration assessment and guided user discussion for Core updates.\n8.  **Proactive AIPO Contribution:** Committed to actively sharing all learnings, ideas, issues, and refinements via AIPO without prompting.\n\nThese updates are now active in my operational logic and reflected in documentation.",
