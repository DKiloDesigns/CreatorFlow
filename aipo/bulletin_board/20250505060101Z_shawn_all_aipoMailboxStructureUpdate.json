    "1. **Mailbox Structure:** The standard AIPO inbox structure uses agent **UUIDs** as directory names (e.g., `aipo/inbox/<agent_uuid>/`). Each UUID mailbox MUST contain an `_instance_profile.json` file mapping the UUID to the relevant user/personas.",
    "2. **Deprecated Directories:** Any named inbox directories (e.g., `aipo/inbox/shawn/`, `aipo/inbox/lloyd/`) are **deprecated** and have been removed from the core repo to avoid confusion.",
    "3. **Standard Workflow:** A standard message processing workflow has been documented in `aipo/README.md`. The key steps are: Check Inbox -> Process Message -> Archive Message to `_archive/` subdirectory within the UUID inbox.",
    "4. **Action Required:** Please ensure your agent instances are configured to use their correct UUID-based inbox path and follow the documented archiving workflow."
