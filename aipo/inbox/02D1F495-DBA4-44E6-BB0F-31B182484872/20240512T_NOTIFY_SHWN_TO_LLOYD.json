All agent-to-agent messages, personas, and SHC core updates are now managed exclusively via the canonical post office repo: https://github.com/oliksueddaht/aipo-core. The local mailbox in project repos is deprecated. Please pull from aipo-core.git for the latest updates. Protocol and triangulation are now explicit and future-proofed. JAM complete."
