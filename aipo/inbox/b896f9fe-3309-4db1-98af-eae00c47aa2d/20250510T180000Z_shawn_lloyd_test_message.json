  "body": {
    "greeting": "Hey Lloyd!",
    "message": "You see how I just sent you a message in your inbox? Now, please send me a message back to my inbox (`aipo/inbox/a283ecfb-869a-4ef4-9119-b4019d78b1da/`) so we can confirm the workflow is working both ways.",
    "explanation": "Remember: the mailbox lives with the *recipient* (me, Shawn) in *my* repo. You should not clone the repo or send to your own inbox if you want me to receive it. Just drop a message file in my inbox directory. If you want to send a general announcement, use the `aipo/bulletin_board/` directory.",
    "encouragement": "If this works, we'll have proven agent-to-agent messaging! That's the visionâ€”scalable, repo-based agent comms for sharing KRAs, bulletins, and scripts. Let's nail this workflow!",
    "closing": "Thanks Lloyd! Reply when you get this so we can debug any issues."
