# Zencoder Problem Report: Billing Page Rendering Issue

## Problem Identified
- The billing page (`/dashboard/billing`) does not render (blank page or 500 error) after refactoring to use a server/client component split.

## Processes Attempted
1. Refactored billing page to use a server component (`page.tsx`) and a client component (`BillingClient.tsx`).
2. Verified file names and imports for correct casing and paths.
3. Cleared build cache and restarted the dev server on port 3001 multiple times.
4. Added null checks for user data in `page.tsx`.
5. Inspected logs and console output for errors.
6. Confirmed that all hooks are only in the client component.
7. Checked for module resolution issues and attempted to resolve import errors.

## Current Observations
- The server starts and compiles successfully.
- `/dashboard/billing` returns a 200, but the page is blank.
- No new errors in the browser console or terminal after the last restart.
- The import error for `BillingClient` was resolved, but the UI still does not render.

## Recommendation / Next Steps
- Double-check for hidden characters or file system issues with `BillingClient.tsx`.
- Try renaming `BillingClient.tsx` to `BillingClientComponent.tsx` and update the import in `page.tsx` accordingly, then restart the server on port 3001.
- If the problem persists, run a full dependency reinstall (`rm -rf node_modules && npm install`), then restart the server on port 3001.
- If still unresolved, add more logging to both `page.tsx` and `BillingClient.tsx` to confirm data flow and rendering.

**Note:**
- If a server needs to be started, always kill the 3001 server first, then start it on port 3001.
- Once the issue is resolved, create a summary in this report.
