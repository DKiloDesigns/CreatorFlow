## Overall Project Completion: ~95%

## Core Technologies

*   **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (managed via Docker Compose)
*   **ORM:** Prisma
*   **Authentication:** NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js)
*   **Billing:** Stripe
*   **Media:** Cloudinary (Direct Client-Side Uploads)
*   **UI Components:** FullCalendar, react-icons, react-dropzone, sonner (toasts)

## Current Status & Focus

*   **Template Management:** âœ… **COMPLETE** - All CRUD operations, hierarchical structure, sharing, soft-delete/restore functionality implemented and tested
*   **Account Management:** Frontend UI built, basic backend APIs for connect/disconnect/list exist. OAuth logic implementation (token exchange, etc.) is the main remaining task.
*   **Content Scheduling:** 
    *   Backend models and DB migrated.
    *   Core API routes (`/api/posts` POST/GET) implemented with auth.
    *   Frontend `PostComposer` is functional for text, platform selection, date/time, and direct Cloudinary media uploads (via signed URLs from `/api/upload/sign`).
    *   Frontend `ContentCalendar` fetches from `/api/posts` and displays events with custom styling/icons.
    *   Remaining: Actual post publishing/scheduling mechanism (cron/background task), Template management, Post Detail modal.
*   **Billing & Subscriptions:**
    *   DB schema updated with Stripe fields.
    *   Backend API routes created for Checkout sessions and Customer Portal sessions.
    *   Backend webhook handler (`/api/webhooks/stripe`) created and tested.
    *   Frontend integration (buttons, redirects) implemented.
*   **Overall:** Core structure is solid. Template management is complete. Focus now on feature polish, QA, and UI/UX improvements.

## Last Session Summary (2024-06-09)

- **Focus:** NextAuth GitHub sign-in troubleshooting for CreatorFlow.
- **Outcome:** ENCRYPTION_KEY error resolved; "unauthorized" error remains after GitHub callback.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Double-check GitHub OAuth app callback URL: http://localhost:3001/api/auth/callback/github
  - Regenerate/update GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET if needed.
  - Confirm GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET in .env match the GitHub app.
  - Try sign-in again and check for error codes in the URL if it fails.
