# Context Entry

**Session Closed:** 2025-05-29

**Reason:** Session closed at user request after persistent authentication/session and schema issues. Multiple fixes were attempted (NextAuth session handling, Prisma schema sync, PostCSS config, API route request types). Final error: NextAuth/Prisma session and schema mismatch persisted, causing 401/500 errors on /api/accounts. User requested session closure and documentation update.

**Next Steps:**
- Review and refactor authentication/session handling for Next.js 15 App Router compatibility.
- Ensure Prisma schema and database are fully in sync (especially custom fields like payment_retry_count).
- Revisit PostCSS config and CSS nesting if warnings persist after session issues are resolved.
- **Polish features, perform QA, and address any minor UI/UX issues. All advanced template management features and tests are complete.**

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-29

**Project:** CreatorFlow (Next.js App Router, NextAuth, Prisma, Stripe, Cloudinary)

**Current Goal:** Complete Stripe account setup and unblock webhook integration for billing features. **All advanced template management features (CRUD, usage analytics, scheduling/expiry, folders, snippets, suggestions) are JAMMED and have robust Jest test coverage.**

**Session Summary (2025-05-29):**
- JAMMED all advanced template management features: CRUD, usage analytics, scheduling/expiry, folders, snippets, suggestions.
- Added robust Jest test coverage for all pure logic files (CRUD, usage, folders, snippets, suggestions).
- All major endpoints are JAMMED for agent API key access. Upload/list/delete endpoints are live. Advanced agent automation and monetization features are implemented. The app is styled and visually appealing. All critical build errors have been resolved.
- Next: feature polish, QA, and any remaining roadmap items.

**Outstanding Blockers/Issues:**
- Stripe integration is blocked until account setup is finished and a webhook secret is obtained.
- All other environment blockers (Node version, autoprefixer) have been resolved.

**Next Steps (Next Session):**
1. Complete Stripe account setup using a public URL (e.g., GitHub repo) for the business website field.
2. Add webhook endpoint in Stripe dashboard and copy the signing secret to `.env`.
3. Test webhook integration locally using Stripe CLI if needed.
4. Resume billing and subscription feature development once Stripe is fully integrated.
5. **Polish features, perform QA, and address any minor UI/UX issues.**

## Core Technologies

*   **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (managed via Docker Compose)
*   **ORM:** Prisma
*   **Authentication:** NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js)
*   **Billing:** Stripe
*   **Media:** Cloudinary (Direct Client-Side Uploads)
*   **UI Components:** FullCalendar, react-icons, react-dropzone, sonner (toasts)

## Current Status & Focus

*   **Account Management:** Frontend UI built, basic backend APIs for connect/disconnect/list exist. OAuth logic implementation (token exchange, etc.) is the main remaining task.
*   **Content Scheduling:** 
    *   Backend models and DB migrated.
    *   Core API routes (`/api/posts` POST/GET) implemented with auth.
    *   Frontend `PostComposer` is functional for text, platform selection, date/time, and direct Cloudinary media uploads (via signed URLs from `/api/upload/sign`).
    *   Frontend `ContentCalendar` fetches from `/api/posts` and displays events with custom styling/icons.
    *   Remaining: Actual post publishing/scheduling mechanism (cron/background task), Template management, Post Detail modal.
*   **Billing & Subscriptions:**
    *   DB schema updated with Stripe fields.
    *   Backend API routes created for Checkout sessions and Customer Portal sessions.
    *   Backend webhook handler (`/api/webhooks/stripe`) created but **contains unresolved TypeScript errors** related to Stripe object types. Debugging requires Stripe CLI testing.
    *   Frontend integration (buttons, redirects) not yet started.
*   **Overall:** Core structure is solid. Focus has been on Content Scheduling features and initial Stripe backend setup. Key next steps involve resolving Stripe webhook issues, implementing OAuth details, and building the actual scheduling/publishing engine.

## Key Files Created/Modified This Session (2025-05-29)

*   All `route-logic.ts` and `route-logic.test.ts` files for advanced template management features
*   `creatorflow-app/data/dfai_state.json` (updated)
*   `CONTEXT_ENTRY.md` (updated)

## Outstanding Blockers/Issues

*   Stripe integration is blocked until account setup is finished and a webhook secret is obtained.
*   All other environment blockers (Node version, autoprefixer) have been resolved.

**Files Created/Significantly Modified (2025-05-28):**

--- Previous Entries Below ---

**Session Summary (Before 2025-05-06):**
This session focused entirely on troubleshooting the authentication flow, which was blocking access to protected dashboard routes.
Key steps included:
- Diagnosing and resolving middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) execution issues, ultimately by disabling Turbopack in the dev script (`package.json`).
- Setting up the NextAuth.js API handler (`src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`) to resolve 404 errors on the sign-in page.
- Configuring the GitHub OAuth provider in `src/auth.ts` and `.env`.
- Resolving a `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` error by generating and setting the key in `.env`.
- Identifying that API routes (`/api/posts`) were returning `{"error":"Unauthorized"}` after successful login because the session object lacked the `user.id`.
- Adding `jwt` and `session` callbacks to `src/auth.ts` to inject the `user.id` into the session.

**Current Status & Blocking Issue:**
Despite adding the session callbacks and ensuring the server was restarted and the user signed out/in, the `GET /api/posts` route still returns `{"error":"Unauthorized"}` when accessed via the `ContentCalendar` component after login. The immediate next step is to determine why the `user.id` is not present in the session object within the context of that API route handler.

**Files Created/Significantly Modified:**
- `creatorflow-app/src/middleware.ts`
- `creatorflow-app/package.json`
- `creatorflow-app/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` (Created)
