# Context Entry

**Session Closed:** 2025-07-04

**Reason:** Session completed successfully after comprehensive authentication system cleanup and implementation. Email check logic working, duplicate pages removed, routing consolidated, and production-ready auth flow established. Ready for platform API integration.

**Next Steps:**
- Platform API Integration: Connect social media platform APIs (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, X/Twitter)
- OAuth Implementation: Platform-specific OAuth flows for content publishing
- Content Scheduling: Post scheduling and automation features
- Advanced Analytics: Enhanced reporting, custom dashboards, data visualization

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-04

## Overall Project Completion: ~99%

## Core Technologies

*   **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (managed via Docker Compose)
*   **ORM:** Prisma
*   **Authentication:** NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js) - **100% Complete**
*   **Billing:** Stripe
*   **Media:** Cloudinary (Direct Client-Side Uploads)
*   **UI Components:** FullCalendar, react-icons, react-dropzone, sonner (toasts)

## Current Status & Focus

*   **Authentication System:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Intelligent email checking, combined signup/signin flow, OAuth integration, comprehensive error handling, production-ready
*   **Template Management:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - All CRUD operations, hierarchical structure, sharing, soft-delete/restore functionality implemented and tested
*   **Account Management:** Frontend UI built, basic backend APIs for connect/disconnect/list exist. OAuth logic implementation (token exchange, etc.) is the main remaining task.
*   **Content Scheduling:** 
    *   Backend models and DB migrated.
    *   Core API routes (`/api/posts` POST/GET) implemented with auth.
    *   Frontend `PostComposer` is functional for text, platform selection, date/time, and direct Cloudinary media uploads (via signed URLs from `/api/upload/sign`).
    *   Frontend `ContentCalendar` fetches from `/api/posts` and displays events with custom styling/icons.
    *   Remaining: Actual post publishing/scheduling mechanism (cron/background task), Template management, Post Detail modal.
*   **Billing & Subscriptions:**
    *   DB schema updated with Stripe fields.
    *   Backend API routes created for Checkout sessions and Customer Portal sessions.
    *   Backend webhook handler (`/api/webhooks/stripe`) created and tested.
    *   Frontend integration (buttons, redirects) implemented.
*   **Overall:** Core structure is solid. Authentication and template management are complete. Focus now on platform API integration and content publishing features.
