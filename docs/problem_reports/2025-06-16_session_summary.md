# Session Summary â€” 2025-06-16

## Session Focus
- Troubleshooting Cypress E2E authentication for billing flows using GitHub OAuth and NextAuth.
- Ensuring robust documentation and problem reporting for all encountered issues.

---

## Key Actions & Findings
1. **Cypress Test Setup**
   - Attempted to automate GitHub OAuth login for Cypress E2E tests using `cy.origin`.
   - Multiple iterations to resolve Cypress cross-origin and timing issues.

2. **Problem Encountered**
   - Cypress failed to handle the GitHub OAuth redirect due to browser security and cross-origin limitations.
   - The polling approach using `cy.window()` did not work, as Cypress cannot access the window object of a third-party domain.

3. **Problem Report Created**
   - Documented the issue in `docs/problem_reports/2025-06-16_cypress_github_oauth_timeout.md`.
   - Updated `docs/problem_reports/INDEX.md` to reflect only current, relevant problem reports.

4. **Documentation & Protocols**
   - All troubleshooting steps, findings, and recommendations are logged in the problem report.
   - End-of-session protocol followed: state is anchored, and next steps are clear.

## Continuity Anchor for Next Session
- **Primary Anchor:**  
  - Review `docs/problem_reports/2025-06-16_cypress_github_oauth_timeout.md` for a detailed account of the Cypress authentication issue and recommendations.
- **Next Steps:**  
  - Consider implementing programmatic authentication for Cypress E2E tests (recommended by Cypress docs).
  - Alternatively, explore stubbing/mocking OAuth or using a test-only login endpoint.
