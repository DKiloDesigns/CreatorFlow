# Billing Page Type Errors Resolution

## Issues Fixed

1. **Server Component Type Error**
   - Added proper TypeScript typing for the `searchParams` parameter in the billing page server component
   - Added metadata export for better SEO and page information

2. **Client Component Type Error**
   - Created detailed type definitions for all client components:
     - `BillingClientProps` interface for BillingClient.tsx
     - `BillingClientComponentProps` interface for BillingClientComponent.tsx
     - `SimpleBillingClientProps` interface for SimpleBillingClient.tsx
   - Properly typed all properties passed from the server component to the client components
   - Ensured consistent type definitions across all client components

3. **Cypress Type Definitions**
   - Fixed "Cannot use namespace 'Cypress' as a value" error by:
     - Moving type definitions directly into the commands.ts files
     - Using the `declare global` syntax to properly extend the Cypress namespace
     - Adding `export {}` to make the files proper modules
   - Cleaned up the commands.ts files to remove unnecessary comments and improve code clarity

4. **Multiple Client Component Issues**
   - Identified and fixed issues with multiple client components:
     - Ensured proper type definitions in all client components
     - Verified 'use client' directive is properly formatted in all components
     - Maintained all client components for potential testing/debugging purposes

## Changes Made

1. Updated `/creatorflow-app/src/app/dashboard/billing/page.tsx`:
   - Added proper type definition for the `searchParams` parameter
   - Added metadata export for better SEO
   - Improved code organization and readability

2. Updated `/creatorflow-app/src/app/dashboard/billing/BillingClient.tsx`:
   - Created a detailed `BillingClientProps` interface
   - Properly typed all properties including nested objects and arrays

3. Created `/creatorflow-app/cypress/support/commands.d.ts`:
   - Added proper type definitions for custom Cypress commands
   - Added JSDoc comments for better developer experience

4. Updated Cypress support files:
   - Improved type definitions in both the main project and creatorflow-app
   - Added proper documentation and cleaned up code

## Benefits

1. **Improved Type Safety**
   - The TypeScript compiler can now properly check types across components
   - Prevents runtime errors related to undefined properties or incorrect types

2. **Better Developer Experience**
   - Proper type definitions provide better autocomplete and documentation
   - Easier to understand the data flow between server and client components

3. **Maintainability**
   - Code is now more self-documenting with proper types
   - Easier to refactor and extend in the future

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding similar type definitions to other server/client component pairs
2. Implement proper error boundaries in client components for better error handling
3. Add unit tests to verify the component behavior with different data scenarios
