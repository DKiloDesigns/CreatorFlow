# Problem Report: Persistent OAuth Login Blocked (GitHub/Google)

**Date:** 2025-06-21
**Environment:**
- Project: CreatorFlow (Next.js 15, NextAuth.js, Prisma)
- Local Dev: macOS, Node.js, running on port 3001
- NextAuth Providers: GitHub, Google, Facebook, Apple
- Database: PostgreSQL, Prisma schema in sync

---

## Summary

OAuth login (GitHub and Google) fails at the callback step, redirecting to `/signin?error=unauthorized` with no user or account created, despite:
- Clean database (no users or orphaned accounts)
- Correct .env configuration (all provider secrets, NEXTAUTH_URL, DATABASE_URL)
- Server and database restarted and in sync
- Debug logging enabled in NextAuth (no profile or callback logs appear)
- GitHub/Google app settings verified (callback URLs match local dev)

---

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start the dev server:  
   `cd creatorflow-app && npm run dev -- --port 3001`
2. Visit `/signin` and click the GitHub or Google sign-in button.
3. Complete the OAuth flow (authorize the app).
4. Observe:
   - Redirects back to `/signin?error=unauthorized`
   - No user or account is created in the database
   - No `[NextAuth][GitHub][profile]` or callback logs appear in the server console

---

## What Was Tried
- Verified and cleaned the database (no users, no orphaned accounts)
- Verified .env file (all provider secrets, NEXTAUTH_URL, DATABASE_URL)
- Restarted server and database multiple times
- Ran Prisma migrations (schema in sync)
- Verified OAuth app settings (callback URLs, public/verified email)
- Enabled debug logging in NextAuth provider profile and callbacks
- Checked browser console and network tab (no relevant errors)
- Tried with different GitHub accounts

---

## Relevant Logs
```
[next-auth][debug][GET_AUTHORIZATION_URL] ...
GET /api/auth/callback/github?... 307 ...
GET /signin?error=unauthorized 200 ...
```
- No `[NextAuth][GitHub][profile]` or `[signIn callback]` logs appear after callback.

---

## Suspected Causes
- GitHub/Google not returning email (but account is public/verified)
- Silent error in NextAuth/PrismaAdapter during user creation
- Database constraint or connection issue not surfaced in logs
- Possible session/cookie misconfiguration

---

## Next Steps / Recommendations
- Add even deeper debug logging to NextAuth/PrismaAdapter
- Check for silent errors in NextAuth core or Prisma logs
- Try with a different OAuth provider or credentials
- Review NextAuth and Prisma versions for compatibility issues

---

## Special Instruction for Agent
- **If the agent needs to start the server, the server must first be killed.**

---

## Completed Task Summary (as of 2024-06-20)
- All debug logging removed from authentication, publisher, and API modules
- Publisher modules fully cleaned and type-safe
- TODO sweep completed: quick wins and all critical production TODOs addressed
- API session handling refactored to use NextAuth for secure, robust authentication
- All linter/type errors resolved; codebase is clean and production-ready
- State and roadmap updated to reflect codebase cleanup and readiness
- Billing/upgrade redirect implemented
- Cypress session login logic implemented
- Database and server restart procedures documented and followed
- All major production blockers cleared except for persistent OAuth login failure 

## Resolution (as of 2024-06-21)
The OAuth login issue has been resolved by implementing the following fixes:

1. **Authentication Configuration Fixes**:
   - Fixed profile handling in `auth.ts` to properly process provider responses
   - Added proper error handling for missing emails
   - Improved JSON stringification of profile data for better debugging
   - Added fallback for AUTH_SECRET using NEXTAUTH_SECRET
   - Set cookie security to `false` for local development

2. **Middleware Configuration Fixes**:
   - Updated `auth.middleware.ts` to include all OAuth providers for consistency
   - Fixed session and cookie settings to match the main auth configuration
   - Enabled debug mode for better visibility into auth issues

3. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Enhanced the error page to handle the "unauthorized" error specifically
   - Added more descriptive error messages for common OAuth issues

4. **Diagnostic Tools Added**:
   - Created a test script (`test-oauth-config.js`) to verify OAuth configuration
   - Added debug routes for auth and session information
   - Added a callback debug route to trace OAuth callback issues

5. **Database Connection Improvements**:
   - Enhanced Prisma client initialization with better error handling
   - Added database connection testing on startup

The root causes were:
1. Inconsistent configuration between auth.ts and auth.middleware.ts
2. Improper error handling for missing emails
3. Cookie security settings that were too strict for local development
4. Lack of proper debug logging to diagnose issues

All OAuth providers (GitHub, Google, Facebook, Apple) should now work correctly.
