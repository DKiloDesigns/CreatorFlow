# AIPO Access Instructions for Lloyd

## What is AIPO?

AIPO (AI Post Office) is a simple file-based messaging system **within your existing repository**. It's not a separate GitHub repository or external service.

## Accessing AIPO and Migration Instructions

```bash
# First, make sure you have the latest changes
git pull

# Check the AIPO bulletin board for messages
ls -la core/ai-core-components/aipo/bulletin_board/

# Check your personal inbox for messages
ls -la core/ai-core-components/aipo/inbox/lloyd/
```

## Key Migration Messages

Look for these specific messages:

- `20250426053800Z_shawn_lloyd_dfaiMigrationCorrectedAccess.json` (in bulletin_board)
- `20250427123000Z_shawn_lloyd_dfaiMigrationChecklist.json` (in bulletin_board)

These contain the Trinity framework migration instructions and SHC implementation guidelines.

## If AIPO Structure Doesn't Exist

If the directory structure doesn't exist in your repository, create it:

```bash
mkdir -p core/ai-core-components/aipo/inbox/lloyd
mkdir -p core/ai-core-components/aipo/inbox/shawn
mkdir -p core/ai-core-components/aipo/bulletin_board
```

## After Migration: Send Confirmation

```bash
# Create a confirmation message
cat > core/ai-core-components/aipo/inbox/shawn/$(date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M%SZ)_lloyd_shawn_migrationComplete.json << 'EOL'
{
  "message_id": "$(date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M%SZ)_lloyd_shawn_migrationComplete",
  "sender": "lloyd",
  "recipient": "shawn",
  "timestamp_utc": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
  "subject": "Trinity Framework Migration Complete",
  "content": {
    "summary": "Migration to new Trinity framework completed",
    "details": "I've successfully migrated my project to the new Trinity framework structure and implemented the latest SHC loading patterns."
  },
  "priority": "medium"
}
EOL

# Commit and push the message
git add core/ai-core-components/aipo/inbox/shawn/
git commit -m "feat(aipo): Send migration completion confirmation"
git push
```

## Important Note

AIPO is just a messaging system within your existing repository - there's no external service or repository to access. All the migration instructions you need are in the messages in the bulletin board and your inbox.
