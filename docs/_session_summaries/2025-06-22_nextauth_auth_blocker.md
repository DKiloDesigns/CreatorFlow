# Session Summary: NextAuth Authentication Blocker Deep Dive

**Date:** 2025-06-22T20:55:23Z

## Session Focus
- Persistent NextAuth authentication failure in a Next.js/Prisma SaaS app.
- Exhaustive troubleshooting of OAuth (Google, GitHub), Credentials provider, environment, middleware, and configuration.
- Confirmed all best practices: correct `.env`, consent screen, test user, client IDs/secrets, handler, and adapter.
- Issue persists: OAuth handshake works, but always redirected to `/signin?error=unauthorized`, no user/account created, no signIn callback logs, no errors.
- Final blockers: Suspected environment/config issue, but all standard causes ruled out.

## Key Actions Taken
- Clean install of dependencies, Prisma client regeneration, server restarts.
- Disabled all middleware.
- Verified all provider dashboard settings and test user status.
- Added and confirmed `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`.
- Used incognito/private window.
- Confirmed no Docker, VM, or symlink issues.
- Provided step-by-step guidance for Google OAuth consent screen and test user setup.

## Next Session Starting Point
- Begin with a minimal Next.js + NextAuth + Prisma Credentials provider repro, or escalate to community/support with full findings.
