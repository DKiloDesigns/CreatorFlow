# Session Summary: 2024-06-23 NextAuth Credentials & Session Context

**Session Date:** 2024-06-23
**Focus:**
- NextAuth credentials login (email/password)
- Prisma schema/database sync
- Resolving App Router vs Pages Router API route conflicts
- Ensuring session context is available everywhere
- Creating and updating KRA documentation and roadmap

**Outcome:**
- Credentials login is fully functional using the Pages Router API route.
- Prisma and the database are in sync with a seeded test user.
- Session context is available everywhere via a client-side Providers component.
- All App Router API route conflicts have been removed.
- KRA and roadmap updated for future agents.

**Notes:**
This session was stressful due to persistent Next.js/App Router/NextAuth edge cases, but all issues were resolved and the system is now robust and well-documented. Ended on a positive note with a working, maintainable authentication flow.
