# Session Summary

**Date:** 2024-06-09 UTC
**Agent:** AI Assistant
**User:** darrellmayberry

## Focus
- Troubleshooting NextAuth GitHub sign-in for CreatorFlow (Next.js app).

## Key Actions
- Diagnosed and resolved ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable error (was not 32 characters due to duplicate lines).
- Guided user to remove duplicate/incorrect ENCRYPTION_KEY lines from .env.
- Server now starts without ENCRYPTION_KEY fatal error.
- NextAuth GitHub sign-in now fails with "unauthorized" after callback.

## Outcome
- ENCRYPTION_KEY issue fully resolved.
- "unauthorized" error remains, likely due to GitHub OAuth app misconfiguration or credential mismatch.

## Next Steps
- Double-check GitHub OAuth app's Authorization callback URL matches exactly:  
  `http://localhost:3001/api/auth/callback/github`
- Regenerate and update GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET if needed.
- Confirm GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET in .env match the GitHub app.
- Try sign-in again and check for error codes in the URL if it fails.
