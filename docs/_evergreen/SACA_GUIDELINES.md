# SACA GUIDELINES: SEXY ACCESSIBILITY COMPLIANCE ALLIANCE

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Active

## INTRODUCTION

This document defines the core principles and guidelines for the **Sexy Accessibility Compliance Alliance (SACA)** as applied within the **BizAssist Dashboard** project. All development MUST adhere to these guidelines to ensure our products are accessible, reusable, monetizable, and uphold the SACA mission.

**SACA Mission:** To create accessible, inclusive _and_ sexy user experiences in _everything_ we do.

This document serves as the primary reference for SACA principles. The mandatory development process incorporating these principles is detailed in `Context/WORKFLOW_RULES.md` (specifically the SACA "-ize" Methodology).

## CORE SACA PRINCIPLES

These principles guide all design and development decisions:

1.  **Accessibility First, Not Afterthought:**

    - Design and build with WCAG 2.1 AA (or higher) compliance from the outset.
    - Prioritize semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, sufficient contrast, and screen reader compatibility.
    - Use automated testing (e.g., axe-core) and manual testing (including screen readers).

2.  **Sexy By Default (Beauty Through Constraints):**

    - Treat accessibility constraints as design opportunities, not limitations.
    - Strive for elegant, clean, and aesthetically pleasing interfaces that _are_ accessible.
    - Accessibility enhances usability and focus, contributing to good design.

3.  **Component Architecture (Self-Contained, Reusable, Extendable):**

    - Build UI elements as modular, self-contained components.
    - Components should encapsulate their structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JS).
    - Prioritize reusability across different contexts.
    - Design for composability and extensibility.
    - Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., BEM-like `saca-[component]__[element]--[modifier]`).

4.  **Monetization Ready:**

    - Design components with a clear value proposition, considering their potential as standalone assets.
    - Ensure clean external interfaces (props, APIs) that facilitate reuse or independent licensing.
    - Minimize external dependencies to allow for easier packaging.
    - Document potential monetization angles in the corresponding Definition Document (see Workflow Rules).

5.  **Progressive Enhancement:**

    - Ensure core functionality works without JavaScript where feasible.
    - Enhance the experience for users with more capable browsers/devices.
    - Prioritize a solid, accessible baseline experience.

6.  **Consistency with Purpose:**

    - Maintain consistency in design patterns, interaction models, and visual language (using design tokens).
    - Allow purposeful variation only when it demonstrably improves user experience or accessibility.

7.  **Educational Integration:**
    - Components and documentation should serve as examples of SACA best practices.

## MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

All development MUST follow the **SACA "-ize" Methodology** detailed in `Context/WORKFLOW_RULES.md`, which incorporates these principles throughout its phases (Analyze, Categorize, Strategize, Prioritize, Optimize, Componentize, Test-with-eyez, Monetize).

## KEY GUIDELINES (Highlights - Refer to Specific Protocols for Details)

- **Testing:** Rigorous testing is mandatory, including automated checks, accessibility scans, and the **non-negotiable "Test-with-eyez"** visual verification step (see Workflow Rules & Testing Protocol).
- **Documentation:** All reusable/monetizable components/features MUST be documented using the **Product/Component Documentation & Cross-Linking Protocol** (see Workflow Rules).
- **Design Tokens:** Use established design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) for consistency. (Define these in `src/theme.ts` or a dedicated token system).
- **Naming Conventions:** Follow consistent naming conventions for CSS classes, JS functions, etc.

## ENFORCEMENT

Adherence to SACA Guidelines is mandatory. Compliance will be tracked via testing results, documentation checks, and potentially visualized in the future Mission Control dashboard within BizAssist. Non-compliance may block deployment.
