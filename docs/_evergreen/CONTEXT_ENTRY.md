# Session Summary (YYYY-MM-DD) - Purchase Order Module Phase 1 & 2

**Goal:** Implement backend and frontend foundations for Purchase Order management.

**Key Developments:**

1.  **Backend Service (`services/purchaseOrderService.ts`):**
    *   Created functions for CRUD operations on Purchase Orders (POs) and PO Items.
    *   Implemented `listPurchaseOrders` with filtering (status, supplier, date) and pagination.
    *   Added user ownership checks to service functions (`getPurchaseOrderById`, `updatePurchaseOrderStatus`, `receivePurchaseOrder`).
    *   Implemented `receivePurchaseOrder` using a DB transaction to update PO status to `RECEIVED` and create corresponding `StockMovement` records.
    *   Added basic PO number generation (needs improvement for robustness).
2.  **Database (`prisma/schema.prisma`):**
    *   Added `PurchaseOrder` and `PurchaseOrderItem` models.
    *   Added `PurchaseOrderStatus` enum.
    *   Added `RECEIVED_PURCHASE_ORDER` to `StockMovementReason` enum.
    *   Added relation between `StockMovement` and `PurchaseOrder` (`purchaseOrderId`).
    *   Ran migration `add_po_received_reason_and_link`.
3.  **API Routes:**
    *   `app/api/inventory/purchase-orders/route.ts`: Handles `GET` (list with filters/pagination) and `POST` (create).
    *   `app/api/inventory/purchase-orders/[poId]/route.ts`: Handles `GET` (details) and `PATCH` (update status).
    *   `app/api/inventory/purchase-orders/[poId]/receive/route.ts`: Handles `PATCH` to trigger the receiving process.
    *   Routes include validation using Zod and user authentication (`getUserIdFromRequest`).
4.  **Frontend Components:**
    *   `components/inventory/po-columns.tsx`: TanStack Table column definitions for PO list.
    *   `components/inventory/purchase-order-list.tsx`: Client component using `DataTable` to display POs, fetch data, handle loading/error, includes filtering input and 'Create' button.
    *   `components/inventory/purchase-order-form.tsx`: Client component using `react-hook-form` and Zod for creating POs, including dynamic item management and fetching suppliers/products.
5.  **Frontend Pages:**
    *   `app/dashboard/inventory/purchase-orders/page.tsx`: Server page displaying the PO list component.
    *   `app/dashboard/inventory/purchase-orders/create/page.tsx`: Server page displaying the PO creation form.
    *   `app/dashboard/inventory/purchase-orders/[poId]/page.tsx`: Server page displaying PO details (fetched server-side).

**Next Steps:**

*   Implement frontend components/logic for:
    *   Using pagination/filters on the PO list page.
    *   Updating PO status on the detail page.
    *   Triggering the 'Receive Order' action on the detail page.
*   Refine PO number generation in `createPurchaseOrder` service.
*   Implement partial receiving logic if needed.

**Monetization Opportunities:**
*   Premium features: Automated reminders, accounting integrations, advanced purchasing analytics.
*   Tiered limits on number of POs or features like custom statuses/workflows.

**Files Created/Modified:**

*   `services/purchaseOrderService.ts`
*   `app/api/inventory/purchase-orders/route.ts`
*   `app/api/inventory/purchase-orders/[poId]/route.ts`
*   `app/api/inventory/purchase-orders/[poId]/receive/route.ts`
*   `prisma/schema.prisma`
*   `components/inventory/po-columns.tsx`
*   `components/inventory/purchase-order-list.tsx`
*   `app/dashboard/inventory/purchase-orders/page.tsx`
*   `components/inventory/purchase-order-form.tsx`
*   `app/dashboard/inventory/purchase-orders/create/page.tsx`
*   `app/dashboard/inventory/purchase-orders/[poId]/page.tsx`

**Goal:** Develop Frontend UI for Quote Management (Phase 2).

**Key Developments:**
- Created core UI components for Quote management: columns, list view, form, line items (placeholder), submit button.
- Implemented pages for listing (`/dashboard/sales/quotes`), creating (`.../create`), and editing (`.../[quoteId]/edit`) quotes.
- Integrated data fetching (list, single quote, customers) with loading, error, and not-found states.
- Added CRUD action handlers (Send, Convert, Delete) to the quote list actions menu, including API calls and toast notifications.
- Polished UI: Added confirmation dialogs for destructive/irreversible actions (delete, convert), improved status badge colors, added loading spinners, created and integrated a Breadcrumbs component, and refined the DataTable 'No results' message.

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `components/sales/quote-columns.tsx`
- `components/sales/quote-list.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/sales/quotes/page.tsx`
- `components/sales/quote-form.tsx`
- `components/ui/form-submit-button.tsx`
- `components/sales/quote-line-items.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/sales/quotes/create/page.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/sales/quotes/[quoteId]/edit/page.tsx`
- `components/ui/loading-spinner.tsx`
- `components/ui/breadcrumbs.tsx`
- `components/ui/data-table.tsx`

**Next Steps:**
- Refine `QuoteLineItems` (product selection, calculations).
- Implement Product Service/API.
- Testing & Debugging.
- Address persistent linter errors (Prisma types, form component path).
