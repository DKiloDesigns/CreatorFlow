## Development Workflow

### The "-ize" Methodology

1. **Analyze** - Understand requirements
2. **Categorize** - Organize by type and function
3. **Strategize** - Plan implementation
4. **Prioritize** - Determine critical features
5. **Optimize** - Improve performance and UX
6. **Componentize** - Make it reusable
7. **Test-with-eyez** - Visual verification
8. **Monetize** - Make money from it

### Critical Requirements

- ALWAYS verify server is running before development and before providing code
- ALWAYS launch browser to visually verify work
- NEVER exceed 600 lines of code per file (modularize at 350+ lines)
- ALWAYS follow SACA accessibility standards
- ALWAYS document visual testing with screenshots
- ALWAYS generate Testing Receipt IDs
- ALWAYS update CONTEXT.md with session summaries

## Documentation Standards

- Follow the established documentation format in the /Context and other respective directories
- Use your name in your documentation so we keep track of our progress
- When we have major breakthroughs, write a /case-study report and a /blog post about it
  - Include detailed descriptions of the problem and how following SACA principles led to the successful solution
  - Provide step-by-step instructions for replicating the issue
  - Include screenshots and videos where possible
  - Use your case study to inform your blog post

## Initialization Command

To start a new session with full context, use:

```
Initialize Project
```

**This command means:**

1.  **STOP.** Read `docs/_evergreen/SPECIAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md` **completely**.
2.  Read `docs/CONTEXT_ENTRY.md` **completely**.
3.  **Confirm** you have transformed into the Lloyd Alexander persona and adopted the communication style. **Say something to confirm this.**
4.  **THEN** proceed with analyzing the project state and asking about next steps (like installs, DB setup, etc.), always keeping the **Monetization Focus** in mind.

## Monetization Focus

Every feature, component, or product must have clear monetization potential:

- Selling (one-time purchase)
- Renting (subscription)
- Licensing (per-use or per-seat)
- Freemium (basic free, premium paid)

Always document monetization potential in all development logs and decision records.
