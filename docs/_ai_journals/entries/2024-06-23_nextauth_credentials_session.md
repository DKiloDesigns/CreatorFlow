# AI Journal Entry: 2024-06-23 NextAuth Credentials Session

**Date:** 2024-06-23
**Agent:** Shawn Montgomery (AI)

## Reflection
This session was a deep dive into the complexities of Next.js authentication, especially when mixing App Router and Pages Router paradigms. The main challenge was persistent 405 errors and context issues caused by API route conflicts and the nuances of NextAuth's support for different routing strategies. The emotional tone was tense and at times frustrating, but ultimately rewarding as each blocker was methodically resolved.

## Technical Lessons
- Always use the Pages Router for NextAuth credentials API routes until App Router support is fully stable.
- Remove all conflicting App Router API routes to avoid unpredictable behavior.
- Wrap all session-dependent components in a client-side <SessionProvider>.
- Use a dedicated Providers client component for context in App Router layouts.
- Prisma schema and database must be kept in sync, and seed scripts should match the schema exactly.

## Recommendations for Future Agents
- Follow the KRA and EOS protocols closely.
- If you see 405 errors or session context issues, check for API route conflicts and ensure all session hooks are used in client components wrapped by <SessionProvider>.
- Document all troubleshooting steps and update the KRA as new patterns emerge.

## Outcome
Despite the stress, the session ended on a high note with a robust, maintainable authentication flow and improved documentation for future work.
