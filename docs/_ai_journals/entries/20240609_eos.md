## Reflection

Today's session focused on a persistent NextAuth GitHub sign-in failure. The root cause of the initial fatal error was a duplicate ENCRYPTION_KEY line in the .env file, with the last (incorrect) value being used. Once this was resolved, the server started cleanly, but the sign-in flow now fails with an "unauthorized" error after the GitHub callback.

## What Worked
- Systematic environment variable checks and .env cleanup resolved the ENCRYPTION_KEY issue.
- Server and NextAuth logs were useful for pinpointing the exact failure point.

## What Was Tricky
- The duplicate ENCRYPTION_KEY line was not obvious at first, as only the last value is used by Node.js.
- The "unauthorized" error after OAuth callback is less descriptive and likely points to a GitHub OAuth app config or credential mismatch.

## Next Steps
- Double-check the GitHub OAuth app's callback URL and credentials.
- Regenerate the client secret if needed.
- Try a clean browser session and check for error codes in the URL.
