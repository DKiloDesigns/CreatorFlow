# AI Journal Entry: NextAuth Authentication Blocker Deep Dive

**Date:** 2025-06-22T20:55:23Z

## Reflection
Today's session was a comprehensive, protocol-driven troubleshooting effort focused on a persistent NextAuth authentication failure. Every major and subtle cause was systematically ruled out, including environment, config, provider dashboard, and codebase issues. The session followed all best practices for documentation, state capture, and context anchoring. The next session will begin with a minimal repro or escalation, as per user instruction. The "Pause, Not Reboot" principle is fully observedâ€”continuity is preserved for a seamless restart.

## Key Learnings
- Silent authentication failures can persist even after all standard fixes; environment and config must be triple-checked.
- Protocol-driven documentation and state capture are essential for continuity and effective escalation.
- The value of methodical, step-by-step troubleshooting and clear session anchoring is reaffirmed.

## Next Steps
- Resume with a minimal Next.js + NextAuth + Prisma Credentials provider repro, or escalate to support/community with full findings.
