# Session Summaries

## Overview

This directory contains detailed summaries of development sessions, documenting work completed, decisions made, and progress achieved. Each summary follows the structure defined in `../SESSION_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Directory Structure

```
session-summaries/
├── YYYY-MM/                    # Organized by year and month
│   ├── YYYY-MM-DD.md          # Individual session summaries
│   └── README.md              # Monthly overview
└── README.md                  # This file
```

## Usage

1. Create a new session summary using the template from `../SESSION_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Name the file using the date format: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. Place it in the appropriate year/month directory
4. Update the monthly README with a summary of key points
5. Link the session summary in the main project journal

## Guidelines

- Keep summaries concise but comprehensive
- Focus on key decisions and outcomes
- Include relevant technical details
- Document any issues or blockers
- Update related documentation as needed

## Integration

- Each session summary should be referenced in:
  - The main project journal (`../journal.md`)
  - The monthly overview README
  - Any relevant technical documentation

## Session Closure: 2025-05-29

**Summary:**
- All advanced template management features (CRUD, usage analytics, scheduling/expiry, folders, snippets, suggestions) are JAMMED and have robust Jest test coverage.
- State (`dfai_state.json`) and roadmap (`CONTEXT_ENTRY.md`) updated to reflect completed features and next steps (polish, QA, minor UI/UX, Stripe integration).
- No critical blockers remain except Stripe webhook setup.
- Session closed per user request, with all documentation and continuity anchors updated.

**Next Steps:**
- Polish features, perform QA, address any minor UI/UX issues.
- Complete Stripe account setup and unblock webhook integration for billing features.
- Resume billing and subscription feature development as needed.

**Session officially closed.**
