Okay, let's create a simplified, text-based prototype to illustrate the core user flows of CreatorFlow. This will focus on the key interactions for connecting an account, scheduling a post, and viewing basic analytics.

Prototype: CreatorFlow (Text-Based)

1\. Navigation:

\-----------------  
1\. Connect Accounts  
2\. Schedule Post

* If user enters 'a' (Instagram):

Connecting to Instagram...  
(Simulate OAuth flow \- in a real app, this would redirect to Instagram for authorization)  
Authorization successful\! Instagram account connected.  
(Redirects back to Connect Accounts screen)

\------------------------------------  
Enter 'back' to return to Platform Selection:

*   
*   
* If user enters 'back' (from Platform Selection):

(Returns to the main Navigation menu)

*   
* 

6\. Brand Collaborations (If user enters '5'):

How to Use This Prototype:

1. Imagine you are a user interacting with CreatorFlow.  
2. Enter numbers or letters to navigate through the different sections.  
3. Follow the prompts and provide simulated input where required (e.g., caption, date/time).  
4. Observe how the basic flows for connecting accounts, scheduling posts, and viewing simplified analytics would work.

Limitations of This Prototype:

* Text-Based: It lacks any visual elements or real-time feedback.  
* Simplified Functionality: It only covers the very basic core features.  
* No Real API Interaction: It doesn't actually connect to any social media platforms or store data.  
* Error Handling: Minimal error handling is shown.

Next Steps After This Prototype:

This simple prototype helps to visualize the basic user flows. The next steps would involve:

1. Creating Wireframes: Developing more detailed visual representations of each screen and their elements.  
2. Developing High-Fidelity Mockups: Designing the actual user interface with the chosen color palette and branding.  
3. Building a Clickable Prototype (using tools like Figma, Adobe XD, etc.): Creating an interactive prototype that simulates user interactions and transitions without actual backend functionality.

This text-based prototype provides a foundational understanding of the user journey within CreatorFlow. Let me know if you'd like to explore a specific flow in more detail\!
