## **CreatorFlow Plan of Completion (v1.1 - Lloyd's Integration Edit)**

**Overall Timeline (Estimated MVP):** 3-5 Months (Aggressive target aligned with Roadmap v1.1)

**Phases:**

**Phase 1: Discovery & Planning (Estimated: 2-3 Weeks)**

*   Goal: Solidify MVP scope based on PRD v3.1 (Free & Pro tiers), finalize core tech/design choices, detail tasks & estimates.
*   Tasks:
    1.  Review & Finalize PRD v3.1/Roadmap v1.1: Ensure alignment and clear MVP scope (Tier 1 + Tier 2 features).
    2.  Target User Validation: Quick interviews/surveys (if needed) to confirm key Pro feature value props.
    3.  Technical Architecture Finalization:
        *   Confirm tech stack (Next.js, DB - likely Postgres, UI Lib, State Mgmt, NextAuth.js).
        *   Design initial DB schema supporting users, accounts, posts, media, **subscriptions, and basic collab data.**
        *   Map out core API routes (Next.js API routes likely sufficient for MVP).
        *   Plan API integration strategies for each platform (OAuth, data points needed for Free/Pro analytics).
        *   **Select & Plan Payment Gateway Integration (e.g., Stripe).**
    4.  Detailed UI/UX Design:
        *   Wireframes for all key screens, **showing differences/prompts for Free vs. Pro tiers.**
        *   High-fidelity mockups (Owner: Darrell) using finalized palette, ensuring WCAG AA contrast.
        *   Design onboarding flow (guiding account connection & highlighting Pro benefits).
    5.  Legal & Compliance Review:
        *   Draft ToS/Privacy Policy considering tiered structure and data usage.
        *   Review API ToS implications for data required by Pro features.
    6.  Detailed Task Breakdown & Estimation:
        *   Break down **PRD v3.1 features (Free & Pro)** into detailed dev tasks.
        *   Estimate effort per task (developer days/hours).
        *   Refine overall timeline based on estimates.
        *   Set up project management board (Trello, Jira, etc.) with tasks.

**Phase 2: Core Backend & Integration (Estimated: 5-8 Weeks - Overlaps Phase 3)**

*   Goal: Build backend logic for core features (Free & Pro), integrate APIs, implement **billing & feature gating.**
*   Tasks:
    1.  Backend Setup & Core Logic:
        *   Setup Next.js project structure, API routes.
        *   Implement NextAuth.js for user auth.
        *   Implement DB models (Prisma recommended) & data access.
        *   Build core scheduling logic.
    2.  **Subscription & Payment Backend:**
        *   **Integrate Stripe API (or chosen provider) for subscription creation, payment processing, webhooks.**
        *   **Implement logic to track user subscription status (Free/Pro).**
    3.  **Feature Gating Logic:**
        *   **Implement middleware or checks to restrict access to Pro features based on subscription status.**
        *   **(e.g., Limit account connections, post counts, analytics depth, collab module access).**
    4.  Social Media API Integration:
        *   Implement OAuth flows (frontend initiates, backend handles callback/tokens).
        *   Develop API interaction functions (posting, fetching Free/Pro analytics data).
        *   Implement robust error handling/rate limiting.
    5.  Media Library Backend:
        *   Implement media upload/storage (Cloudinary/S3) & basic management APIs.
        *   **Implement Pro tier features (folder/tag logic).**
    6.  Task Scheduling Implementation (node-cron/Vercel Cron).
    7.  Analytics Data Processing:
        *   Implement logic to fetch/store **both Free (basic) and Pro (growth/engagement) analytics data.**
    8.  API Route Testing (Postman/Insomnia).

**Phase 3: Frontend Development (Estimated: 6-9 Weeks - Overlaps Phase 2)**

*   Goal: Build UI based on designs, integrate APIs, implement tier differentiation & upgrade prompts.
*   Tasks:
    1.  Project Setup & Core Layout (Next.js, UI Lib).
    2.  Implement Base Layout/Navigation.
    3.  Account Management UI:
        *   Connect/Manage accounts flow (Initiate OAuth).
        *   **UI logic to prevent >2 connections for Free users & show upgrade prompt.**
    4.  Content Creation & Scheduling UI:
        *   Post form, media upload integration.
        *   Scheduling UI (Date picker, etc.).
        *   **UI logic to enforce 30 post/month limit for Free users & show upgrade prompt.**
        *   Content calendar view.
        *   Save/Reuse captions/hashtags UI.
    5.  Media Library UI:
        *   Display/organize media.
        *   **Implement Pro features UI (folders/tags), potentially disabled/prompting upgrade for Free users.**
    6.  Analytics Dashboard UI:
        *   Display Free metrics (basic charts).
        *   **Implement Pro metrics views (growth/engagement charts) - visible but locked/prompting upgrade for Free users.**
        *   Filtering UI.
    7.  Brand Collaboration UI (**Pro Feature**):
        *   Build UI for logging details, linking posts, basic reporting.
        *   **Entire module inaccessible/prompts upgrade for Free users.**
    8.  User Onboarding UI (Highlighting Pro benefits).
    9.  Settings UI (Account, Notifications, Logout).
    10. **Subscription Management UI:**
        *   **Display current plan (Free/Pro).**
        *   **Implement 'Upgrade to Pro' buttons/flows triggering Stripe checkout.**
        *   **(Future: Manage subscription, view invoices).**
    11. Frontend State Management (Zustand/Context).
    12. Frontend Unit/Integration Testing (Jest/RTL).

**Phase 4: Testing & QA (Estimated: 3-5 Weeks - Continuous overlap)**

*   Goal: Ensure quality, functionality, security, and usability across both Free & Pro tiers.
*   Tasks:
    1.  Functional Testing (All features, Free & Pro paths, edge cases).
    2.  **Subscription Flow Testing:** Test upgrade paths, plan changes, payment failures, webhook handling.
    3.  **Feature Gate Testing:** Verify Free users *cannot* access Pro features and see correct prompts.
    4.  Usability Testing (Target users, aim for **SUS Score > 75**).
    5.  Performance Testing (Load times < 2s, API response times).
    6.  Security Testing (Basic checks, OWASP Top 10 awareness, dependency scans).
    7.  **Accessibility Testing (Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance - SACA!).**
    8.  Cross-Browser/Device Testing.
    9.  Bug Fixing & Iteration.
    10. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with target Free & potentially early Pro users.

**Phase 5: Deployment & Launch (Estimated: 1 Week)**

*   Goal: Deploy MVP (Free & Pro tiers) to production.
*   Tasks:
    1.  Deployment Setup (Vercel recommended for Next.js).
    2.  Configure Environment Variables (API keys, DB creds, **Stripe keys - LIVE**).
    3.  Deploy Application.
    4.  Final Production Testing (Smoke tests, **test live payment flow**).
    5.  DNS Configuration.
    6.  Launch & Announce MVP.

**Phase 6: Post-Launch & Iteration (Ongoing)**

*   Goal: Monitor, support, gather feedback, iterate based on data (especially conversion/retention).
*   Tasks:
    1.  Monitoring & Error Tracking (Sentry/LogRocket).
    2.  User Support (Separate channel/priority for Pro?).
    3.  Feedback Collection (Surveys, in-app feedback).
    4.  **Analyze Monetization Metrics:** Track conversion rates, churn, ARPU. Identify friction points in upgrade flow.
    5.  Bug Fixing & Maintenance.
    6.  Plan Next Iteration (Based on Roadmap v1.1 Phase 2, prioritize based on feedback/metrics).
    7.  Marketing & Growth.

**Note:** This plan integrates the tiered monetization strategy directly into the development and testing phases. Timelines are estimates and require validation after detailed task breakdown in Phase 1.
